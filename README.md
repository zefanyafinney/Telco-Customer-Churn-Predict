# Telco-Customer-Churn-Predict

In this project I made a prediction of customer churn in the Telecom company which is predicting which customers are at high risk of leaving the company or canceling service subscriptions, based on their behavior with company product.

I did an analysis with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Telcom customer churn prediction using machine learning with a decision tree and random forest algorithm. I also do the GridSearchCV method to find the best hyperparameters for each algorithm to get the best model.
